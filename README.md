# IIO Utility for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Integration

This repository contains a ported version of the IIO (Industrial I/O) utility for Linux, specifically adapted for compiling with the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The IIO utility allows users to interact with sensors and other devices that are part of the Industrial I/O subsystem in the Linux kernel.

## Prerequisites

- [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/setup/build/initializing)
- Linux-based development environment
- Basic knowledge of AOSP build system

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clon  git@github.com:Jaimin19parmar/iio.git
    ```

2. **Integrate with AOSP:**

    Copy the contents of this repository into your AOSP source tree or create a symbolic link to the external folder within your AOSP source tree.

    ```bash
    ln -s /path/to/iio /path/to/aosp/external/iio-utility
    or cp /path/to/iio  /path/to/aosp/external/iio
    ```

3. **Build Utility:**

    Follow the standard procedure to build your AOSP image. The IIO utility will be included as part of the build process.

    ```bash
    source build/envsetup.sh
    lunch   target
    cd aosp/external/iio/
    mma
    or
    mm
    ```
4. **Output Binary:**

    The output binary by default is at: path/aosp/out/target/product/target/system/bin/


## Usage

After building your AOSP image with the integrated IIO utility, you can use it on your Android device or emulator. Refer to the official IIO utility documentation for specific commands and usage instructions.
